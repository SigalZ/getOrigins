# getOrigins
Trying to get origins that have only active coffees in the relationships

Origin has many Countries
Country has many Green Beans
Green Bean has many Coffees

For each origin I need to display its countries 
For each country display its green beans
For each green bean display its coffees

But all should be display only if there are active coffees in there.
